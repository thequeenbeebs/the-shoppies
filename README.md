# THE SHOPPIES
> This project was made in conjunction with my application for a Frontend Developer Internship with Shopify for Fall 2021. It is an application that uses the React.js library and connects to the OMDB API to allow a user to search for movies and add them to a nomination list (along with removing them). After a user nominates 5 movies, they get a fun surprise.
